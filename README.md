# ThreadX Cpp wrapper APIs
This is written based on [threadx-mcpp](https://github.com/IntergatedCircuits/threadx-mcpp).

It covers all ThreadX APIs (except performance info) and most of FileX and LevelX APIs.

## Compatibility
C++23 and above.

It has been partially tested with ThreadX v6.4.1 using [threadx-cpp-test-app](https://github.com/HosseinSagha/threadx-cpp-test-app).

Happy to look at suggestions and bug reports.
